# PCA Algorithm & Clustering
Steps:
1. Read and understand the data
2. Outlier Testing
3. Visualize the correlation and Data Preparation
4. Use PCA and screeplot for choosing best number of PCs
5. Basis transformation - getting the data onto our PCs
6. Creating correlation matrix for the principal components - we expect little to no correlation
7. Clustering 
    - K-Means
    - Hierarchical
        - Single
        - Complete
8. Inferences
